    <p>This is a very easy and yummy salmon recipe for 2. I usually serve it with basmati rice and salad. Perfect for during the week.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Â½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mild curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 pinches ground ginger</li>
        <li>2 (4 ounce) salmon fillets</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine cream, curry powder, lemon juice, and ginger in a skillet and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and slide salmon into the cream. Cover and simmer until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 12 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillets. </li>
